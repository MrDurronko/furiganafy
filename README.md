# Furiganafy
Converts a string into ruby html, cause doing it yourself is annoying.
<br />
<h1>How to</h1>
<p>Write a string into the textarea, for example</p>
<p>{今}[いま]{何時}[なんじ]ですか</p>
<p>The textbase (今) has to go into curly braces ('{}'), the texttop (いま)　into the other ones ('[]')</p>
<p>Braces inside other braces are being ignored. It's not a smart script, therefore curly braces have to come first.</p>
<br />
<p>Works with any kind of text.</p>
